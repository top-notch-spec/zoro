            &ldquo;Disputes&rdquo;) by engaging in good faith negotiations. Such
            good faith negotiations require, at a minimum, that the aggrieved
            party provide a written notice to the other party specifying the
            nature and details of the Dispute. The party receiving such notice
            shall have thirty (30) days to respond to the notice. Within sixty
            (60) days after the aggrieved party sent the initial notice, the
            parties shall meet and confer in good faith by videoconference, or
            by telephone, to try to resolve the Dispute. If the parties are
            unable to resolve the Dispute within ninety (90) days after the
            aggrieved party sent the initial notice, the parties may agree to
            mediate their Dispute, or either party may submit the Dispute to
            arbitration as set forth below.

          <strong>Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            You and we agree that any Dispute that cannot be resolved through
            the procedures set forth above will be resolved through binding
            arbitration in accordance with the International Arbitration Rules
            of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution. The place of
            arbitration shall be the Cayman Islands. The language of the
            arbitration shall be English. The arbitrator(s) shall have
            experience adjudicating matters involving Internet technology,
            software applications, financial transactions and, ideally,
            blockchain technology. The arbitrator&rsquo;s award of damages must
            be consistent with the terms of the &ldquo;Limitation of
            Liability&rdquo; subsection of these Terms as to the types and
            amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The
            prevailing party will be entitled to an award of their reasonable
            attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs. Except as may be required by law,
            neither a party nor its representatives may disclose the existence,
            content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior
            written consent of (all/both) parties.

            UNLESS BOTH YOU AND WE OTHERWISE AGREE IN WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR
            MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON&rsquo;S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT
            OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
            PROCEEDING.
